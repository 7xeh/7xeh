I build practical and usually small projects that solve a real annoyance.

---

## What I’m about

- Developer + designer mindset
- I like extensions, plugins, and UI that stays out of the way
- Learning in public, shipping when it’s good enough

## What I’m working on

- Improving existing projects (polish, usability, documentation)
- Building small utilities that remove friction

---

## Toolbox (roughly)

- UI/UX: design-first, iterate fast
- Code: whatever fits the project (extensions, plugins, theming)
